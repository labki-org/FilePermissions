## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: PageProps for storage (fast lookup, cached, native MW infrastructure)
- [Init]: Single permission level per file (simple mental model)
- [Init]: JS bridge for MsUpload (avoids forking, uses existing events/hooks)
- [Init]: Group-based only (reduces complexity, aligns with MW permission model)

### Research Flags

- Phase 5 (MsUpload Integration): NEEDS RESEARCH - MsUpload JavaScript API is undocumented

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Infrastructure validation required before Phase 2: web server must block direct /images/ access
- Caching strategy TBD: may need CACHE_NONE for File: namespace if parser cache variants don't work
